# Visualizing models of ecological systems

This is a Java applet I designed almost a decade ago for simulating and visualizing three models of ecological systems. Some background about the models, what they have to do with each other and why they're interesting, is given in [this paper I authored in 2008](Wright2008.pdf). The source code for the applet can be found in the ``java`` directory, while the compiled applet and instructions for running it are in the ``class`` directory.
