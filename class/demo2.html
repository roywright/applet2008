The applet has three panels. In the leftmost, a range of speeds for the predator and prey 1 is given. You may click within the parameter slice to change the speeds (between 1 and 10).<BR><BR>

When new speeds are chosen, the other two panels will update (be patient). The middle panel shows a time series for the two prey species and invading predator. The predator is shown in violet. You may click in this panel to select a particular moment to be highlighted.<BR><BR>

In the third panel, the two prey densities and predator density are plotted as a three-dimensional trajectory. This plot can be rotated by clicking and dragging. Also, you may press buttons 1-3 to view the dynamics in two dimensions. For example, pressing 3 will show the dynamics of prey 1 versus prey 2.
